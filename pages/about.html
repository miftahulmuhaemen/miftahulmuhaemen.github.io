        <h2>About Us!</h2>
        <p>What’s in a name? Well, it turns out – a lot! It is surprising to many that the Pennsylvania SPCA is not associated with the ASPCA or any other SPCAs throughout the state or country. The ASPCA does not serve as a governing body, and though we are all partnering at times to improve animal welfare, we are not formally attached to one another. We are all our own nonprofit with individual missions. The PSPCA’s mission is to protect animals, prevent cruelty and to improve the health and quality of life throughout Pennsylvania. We do this through our four physical locations – North Philadelphia, Danville, Fishtown and Lancaster, as well as through our Humane Law Enforcement Department which covers 23 counties throughout the state.

                So why does this matter? The PSPCA has boots on the ground 365 days a year throughout Pennsylvania. When you support the PSPCA, your donation directly goes toward helping animals suffering from cruelty and neglect in your own community. Thank you for valuing our work and for enabling us to continue our lifesaving mission.</p>
