            <p class="light">A foster parent is someone who provides temporary housing and care for an animal sheltered at the Pennsylvania SPCA. Our Foster Care program is designed to provide a caring home where animals can receive more individualized attention. Sometimes they are recovering from illness, on hold due to a court case, need to be socialized, or arenâ€™t old enough to be placed in a forever home.</p>

            <h5 class="center">Kitten Season</h5>

            <p class="light">The easiest way to help reduce the overwhelming numbers of unwanted cats is to spay and neuter your own cat and encourage others to do the same. Unaltered cats are driven by their hormones and tend to sneak outdoors primarily in search of a mate. Mating just once can start a domino effect that can result in dozens, even hundreds or thousands of unwanted animals.</p>
